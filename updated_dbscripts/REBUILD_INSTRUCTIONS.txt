IMPORTANT: REBUILD APP AFTER INSTALL
=====================================

WHY YOU'RE STILL GETTING ERRORS:
---------------------------------

You installed the NEW database schema - GOOD!
But you're running OLD compiled application code - BAD!

Your Mac application was compiled BEFORE the schema was complete!


SOLUTION - REBUILD THE APPLICATION:
------------------------------------

After running setup_mac.sh, you MUST rebuild the application!

STEP 1: Install the database (you already did this)
    cd updated_dbscripts
    bash setup_mac.sh

STEP 2: Rebuild the application (DO THIS NOW!)
    cd ..                    # Go back to project root
    npm run build            # Rebuild the backend

STEP 3: Restart the application
    npm start                # Or however you start your app


WHAT THIS DOES:
----------------

npm run build:
- Recompiles server/index.ts to dist/index.js
- Uses the LATEST code that expects the NEW schema
- Matches the database you just installed


EXPECTED RESULT:
----------------

After rebuilding, ALL errors should disappear:
- Invoices page will load
- Production entries will load  
- Production reconciliations will load
- No "column does not exist" errors


RUN THIS COMMAND ON YOUR MAC:
------------------------------
    npm run build

(in the project root directory)
