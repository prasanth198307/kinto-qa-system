-- Migration: Production Management Features
-- Date: November 6, 2025, 16:35:00
-- Description: Adds production management related features

-- NOTE: This migration is for reference only
-- The main schema (database_scripts/01_schema.sql) already includes these changes

-- This file was a migration from earlier development
-- For new installations, use database_scripts/01_schema.sql instead

-- If you need the exact migration content, it should already be
-- incorporated into the current schema in shared/schema.ts

-- Run: npm run db:push
-- This will sync your database with the current schema
